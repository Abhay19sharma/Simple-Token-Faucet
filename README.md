# Simple Token Faucet

## Project Description

The **Simple Token Faucet** is a lightweight Soroban smart contract that allows users to claim a fixed amount of tokens one time. Itâ€™s ideal for testing or onboarding new users by giving them an initial token balance.

## Project Vision

To provide a straightforward and gas-efficient method for distributing testnet or demo tokens in a decentralized, transparent, and permissionless manner. It helps developers and users interact with applications without needing to acquire tokens manually.

## Key Features

- **Fixed Token Amount**: Each user receives a predefined token quantity (100 units).
- **Claim Verification**: Check whether a user has already claimed tokens.
- **Claim History**: View all addresses that have claimed from the faucet.
